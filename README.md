# Foram_Detection_v2

To start interface, run foram-v2-gui.py. File first runs an initial setupUI() function, repeatedly runs an update() function, and performs 'connected' functions when the UI is interacted with.

Uses a virtual environment located in C:\forams-project-v2\forams-v2\venv\Scripts\python.exe so should work across users on RASENGAN laptop

Current version of camera (Amscope) only compatible with windows x86

Interface was designed using 'Qt Designer', and the original ui file is 'foram-v2-gui.ui'

For ui to py files use the command:
pyuic5.exe -x ui_file.ui -o python_file.py
